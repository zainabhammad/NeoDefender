# NeoDefender 

Welcome to **NeoDefender**, a game inspired by the movie *The Matrix*. In this game, you control Neo as he navigates through falling pills while trying to save the matrix as long as possible. The goal is to avoid "red pills" and catch "blue pills" to gain points, while managing shields and keeping an eye on the timer.

## Features
- **Falling Objects**: Red and blue pills fall from the top of the screen, which players must interact with to gain or lose shields.
- **Score Tracking**: Track your score, high score, and the time left in the game.
- **Background Music**: Music plays throughout the game to enhance the experience.
- **Shields**: Protect yourself from losing by collecting blue pills, but be careful not to click on red pills.

## Game Logic Overview
- **Falling Objects**: Red and blue pills are randomly generated and fall. The player must click on blue pills for points and avoid red pills, which reduce the player's shields.
- **Timer**: A countdown timer keeps track of the game duration. When the timer reaches zero or all shields are lost, the game ends.


Enjoy the game and good luck, Neo!
